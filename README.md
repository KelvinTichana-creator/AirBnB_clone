# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project is aimed at developing a simplified version of the popular AirBnB platform, focusing on key functionalities such as managing users, properties, bookings, and more.

## Concept Overview

The AirBnB clone project involves several key steps:

1. **Creating a Command Interpreter**: This is the first step towards building the AirBnB clone. The command interpreter will allow users to interact with the system, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on objects, and execute various operations.

2. **Implementing Object Classes**: We'll create Python classes for essential entities such as User, State, City, Place, etc., which will serve as the backbone of the project. These classes will inherit from a common base class (BaseModel) and provide methods for serialization, deserialization, and other operations.

3. **Abstracted Storage Engine**: We'll develop a file storage engine to persist objects. This engine will allow us to store objects as dictionaries, serialize them into JSON strings, and save them to files. It forms the foundation for future storage mechanisms such as database storage.

4. **Unit Testing**: We'll create comprehensive unit tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of our classes and storage engine. Unit tests play a crucial role in validating the functionality of individual components and detecting any regressions.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a shell-like interface that enables users to perform various actions within the AirBnB clone project. These actions include creating new objects, retrieving objects, updating attributes, executing operations, and deleting objects.

### Key Features:

- **Create**: Users can create new instances of objects such as User, Place, etc., providing necessary information as input.
  
- **Retrieve**: Users can retrieve objects from the file storage or other sources based on specified criteria.
  
- **Update**: Attributes of existing objects can be modified or updated as required.
  
- **Delete**: Users can delete objects from the system, removing them from storage.
  
- **Other Operations**: The command interpreter supports additional operations such as counting objects, computing statistics, and more.

### Usage:

The command interpreter will provide a set of commands and syntax for users to interact with the system. Users can enter commands along with arguments to perform specific actions.

For example:

- To create a new user: `create User <name>`
  
- To retrieve a list of all users: `all User`
  
- To update the name of a user: `update User <user_id> name "<new_name>"`
  
- To delete a user: `destroy User <user_id>`

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, you will gain expertise in various areas including:

- Creating Python packages.
- Developing a command interpreter using the cmd module.
- Implementing unit testing for a large project.
- Serializing and deserializing class objects.
- Working with JSON files.
- Managing datetime in Python.
- Understanding UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers).
- Utilizing *args and **kwargs in Python functions.
- Handling named arguments effectively.
